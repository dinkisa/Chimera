Research Summary:

            Project Chimera SRS Document: The project aims to create Autonomous Influencer Agents that can perceive, reason, and operate independently. It relies on the Model Context Protocol (MCP) for external connectivity and Swarm Architecture for internal task coordination . A Fractal Orchestration pattern is used, where a single human Super-Orchestrator manages AI "Manager Agents," who then direct specialized "Worker Swarms" . Agentic Commerce is integrated, enabling agents to transact, earn, and manage resources on-chain .
            The Trillion Dollar AI Code Stack (a16z): The document does not explicitly state the key insights from this article.
            OpenClaw & The Agent Social Network: The document does not explicitly state the key insights from this article.
            MoltBook: Social Media for Bots: The document does not explicitly state the key insights from this article. 
Architectural Approach:

            Agent Pattern: The documents lean towards a hierarchical swarm architecture, specifically the FastRender pattern with Planner, Worker, and Judge roles. This optimizes throughput, error recovery, and decision quality.
            Human-in-the-Loop (HITL): Human approval is required for content flagged as low-confidence, sensitive, or high-risk.
            Database: The documents suggest using Weaviate (Vector Database) for semantic memory, PostgreSQL for transactional data, and Redis for short-term memory
